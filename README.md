# Process-Control-Block

The process control block or PCB are algorithms used for OS to manage its task,
this simulator create dynamic graphic using a canvas.

## Form

This implementation works under a form, where you add every process

![Form](./.example/form.png)

## Simulation

This is an example of a FIFO simulation; until now just some process are avalible...

### To do

- [x] Performe FIFO simulation
- [x] Performe SJF simulation
- [x] Performe Priority simulation
- [ ] Performe Round Robin simulation
- [ ] Scale boxes to fit canvas properly
- [ ] Improve documentation
